# FEM Gravitational Potential

## Differential Equations Project 2023/2024
### 4.4 Gravitational Potential

This repository contains the final project for the Differential Equations course at AGH University of Science and Technology. The project involves the numerical approximation of the finite element method (FEM) for solving the differential equation related to gravitational potential.

## Solution
The detailed calculations and theoretical background can be found in the provided document: [Calculation Documentation (PDF)](doc/obliczenia.pdf).

## Software Requirements
This project was developed using Python 3.11 and the following libraries:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- tkinter

## Visualization
To view the plot of the gravitational potential, run the `main.py` file. This script uses the aforementioned libraries to simulate and visualize the gravitational fields.
